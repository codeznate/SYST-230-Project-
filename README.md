#  Major Pick — College Major Decision Assistant

**Major Pick** is a Python-based desktop application built with `PySide6` that helps students explore and decide on a suitable college major.  
Through a short quiz, users receive a recommended major based on their preferences and personality traits. The app also provides information about each major, including descriptions and related career paths. The program also has a scheduling function where students can insert classes and their relative times and displays within a grid.
When a student has an upcoming class, it will show within the left side of the screen and how far out the class is.
