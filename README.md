# SYST-230-Project-
Development of a website to help undecided/decided college majors!
Step usage so far:
Open command terminal, navigate to appConfig directory
    "cd appConfig"
Run command
    "python -m flask --app app run"
If succeeded, should display
    "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
    "Press CTRL+C to quit
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000
Website should work so far, quiz page being modified to add more questions and better results coming soon. 

Notes**
127.0.0.1 is a loopback address, your computer sends traffic through itself, so it never reaches an outside network. Any computer should be able to run this.
